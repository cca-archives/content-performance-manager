## What does this API do?

This API provides access to time series metrics data about the performance of GOV.UK content. Examples of metrics include unique page views and number of PDF attachments. Refer to the [getting started section][] for a complete list of metrics.

This API does not expose the content itself. Use the [GOV.UK Content API][] to access the content.

## Rate limiting

There is a limit of 10 requests per second per client. All requests over this limit will not be processed, and you will receive a response with `HTTP status code 429 (too many requests)`.

Your application should handle this exception by retrying the request at a later time.

[Contact support][] if you want to increase this limit.

## Version

GOV.UK Content Performance API is currently in alpha and is likely to change between versions.

You may use the API and build applications that use it, but live services should not currently rely on the API or the data it provides.

### Query the API

To query the API, you need to pass the base_path to the content performance API for the piece of content you are interested in.

For example, for https://www.gov.uk/vat-rates, the base_path will be "/vat-rates"

## Getting started

### Get a full list of available metrics

The exact metrics provided by the API may change over time. To retrieve the full list:

```
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer your-token-here' https://content-performance-manager.publishing.service.gov.uk/api/v1/metrics | python -m json.tool
```

```
[
{
  "description": "Number of pageviews",
  "source": "Google Analytics",
  "metric_id": "pageviews"
},
{
  "description": "Number of unique pageviews",
  "source": "Google Analytics",
  "metric_id": "unique_pageviews"
},
{
  "description": "Number of reported content issues",
  "source": "Feedback explorer",
  "metric_id": "feedex_comments"
},
{
  "description": "Number of .pdf attachments",
  "source": "Publishing API",
  "metric_id": "number_of_pdfs"
},
...
]
```

### Get metrics data for a single piece of content

You can use the `/metrics/[metric-id]/[base_path]/` endpoint to get the value of any metric; for example, the number of page views.

To summarise the recorded data over a requested time frame:

```shell
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer your-token-here' https://content-performance-manager.publishing.service.gov.uk/api/v1/metrics//vat-rates?from=2018-02-28&to=2018-02-28&metric=pageviews
```

The `from` and `to` query parameters specify the date range to query.

To get data points for each day in the requested time frame:

```shell
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer your-token-here' https://content-performance-manager.publishing.service.gov.uk/api/v1/metrics/time-series//vat-rates?from=2018-02-28&to=2018-02-28&metric=pageviews
```

## API reference
